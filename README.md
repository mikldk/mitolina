# mitolina: MITOchondrial LINeage Analysis

An R package (<https://www.r-project.org/>) to perform **MITO**chondrial **LIN**eage **A**nalysis 
by simulating genealogies backwards and 
imposing mtDNA including binary mutations forwards. 
This software operates under the maternal inheritance only model, i.e. that mtDNA is only passed on by mothers to children. 
Numerous analyses are possible, e.g. number of matches and meiotic distance to matches.

See documentation included in package (vignettes and manual) at <https://mikldk.github.io/mitolina/>.

## Installation

You first need `R` (<https://www.r-project.org/>). 
Then you can install `mitolina` from GitHub by using the `remotes` package (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes>):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mikldk/mitolina", 
                        build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), 
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The `build_opts` is provided to remove `--no-build-vignettes` such that vignettes are built.

## Getting started

Refer to the included vignettes. You can get an overview of the included vignettes by the following `R` command:

```r
browseVignettes(package = "mitolina")
```

To read a vignette, type:

```r

```
